## Project Overview

This project explores the implementation of real-time object detection using deep learning frameworks. I developed a system that can detect and classify objects in images and video streams with high accuracy and minimal latency.

### Key Features

- **Multi-framework Implementation**: Built models using both TensorFlow and PyTorch to compare performance
- **Model Optimization**: Applied various techniques to optimize model performance for edge devices
- **Real-time Processing**: Achieved 30+ FPS on standard hardware with high detection accuracy
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraged pre-trained models and fine-tuned them for specific use cases
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Created a complete pipeline from training to deployment

## Technical Details

The project utilized several state-of-the-art architectures:

- YOLO (You Only Look Once) for one-stage detection
- Faster R-CNN for two-stage detection
- MobileNet as a lightweight backbone for resource-constrained environments

### Performance Metrics

| Model | mAP (COCO) | Inference Time (ms) | FPS | Memory Footprint |
|-------|------------|---------------------|-----|------------------|
| YOLOv5-s | 56.8% | 6.4 | 156 | 14 MB |
| YOLOv5-m | 64.1% | 8.2 | 122 | 52 MB |
| Faster R-CNN | 67.9% | 23.6 | 42 | 97 MB |
| MobileNetV3 | 51.2% | 3.8 | 263 | 6.7 MB |

## Applications

This object detection system has been applied to several domains:

1. **Traffic Monitoring**: Counting vehicles and monitoring traffic patterns
2. **Retail Analytics**: Customer flow analysis and product interaction detection
3. **Security Systems**: Identifying unauthorized access and suspicious behavior
4. **Manufacturing Quality Control**: Detecting defects in products on assembly lines

## Future Work

I plan to extend this project in several directions:

- Integration with 3D sensor data for depth-aware detection
- Implementation of instance segmentation for more detailed analysis
- Deployment on specialized edge AI hardware
- Exploration of self-supervised learning approaches to reduce the need for labeled data
