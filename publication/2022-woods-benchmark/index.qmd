## Overview

Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is a critical challenge in machine learning. Time series forecasting in particular often faces dramatic distribution shifts when deployed in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce **Woods**, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed specifically to evaluate OOD generalization in time series models.

## Abstract

Time series forecasting models deployed in real-world settings often face dramatic distribution shifts, potentially causing systemic failures. Despite the importance of this problem, there is currently no standardized way to evaluate and compare the OOD generalization capabilities of time series models. This paper introduces **Woods**, a curated collection of real-world time series datasets and an evaluation framework specifically designed to assess how models generalize under various types of distribution shifts.

Our benchmark suite includes diverse domains such as healthcare, energy, finance, and ecology, with clearly defined training/validation/test splits that represent realistic deployment scenarios. We evaluate several state-of-the-art time series models on Woods and demonstrate significant performance degradation under distribution shifts, highlighting the critical need for robust forecasting methods.
